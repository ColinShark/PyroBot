Fill these into the [sample config file](pyrobot.ini.sample).

1. `git clone https://github.com/ColinTheShark/PyroBot.git`
2. Copy or rename [`pyrobot.ini.sample`](pyrobot.ini.sample) to `pyrobot.ini` and fill it out as instructed
3. Start PyroBot with `python -m pyrobot`

You can now log in via Pyrogram and send `.alive` to see your PyroBot working.

If needed, there are [more detailed instructions in the Wiki](https://github.com/ColinTheShark/PyroBot/wiki/Setup)

## Disclaimer
```Python
# PyroBot is a userbot that (soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è) lets you automate things.
# Telegram doesn't like automation.
# If you get banned after using PyroBot, this is your own responsibility.
# If you come to me whining about being banned after using PyroBot, I'll just block you.
